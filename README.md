title: "Residential Micro-Segregation and Social Capital in Lima, Peru: Supplementary Material"
author: Fernando Calderón-Figueroa

These are the supplementary materials to my article published in [*Land's* [special issue on urban micro-segregation](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/land/special_issues/938S2A99L1). The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fcalderonfigueroa/land_microsegregation_lima) includes pre-processed data and code to reproduce the findings. Some of the original datasets are too large to make available in the repository, so I have included links to download them below.

## Raw Data

Here is where to find the raw data files necessary for some of the analyses:

* European Commission's [Global Human Settlement by Degree of Urbanization](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod2023.php).
* Lima Como Vamos' [2010-2019 survey data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ogk4631a37kbxxt/AACYpm_yfIPIuqFR_I3mA5xOa/BD_Lima2010-2019.sav?dl=0).
* Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática's [Socioeconomic data at block level for Lima (2017)](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a929c02371f24525a881155ec39cfe68)

## Figures, Tables, and Preliminary Notes

These are reports with the code to produce the figures in the article. I have also included additional analyses I conducted to verify my findings.
